       <h2> Social Benefits </h2>
      Many people run because they like to socialize and be part of a running community. Running clubs and charity training groups
      give people the opportunity to meet and train with other people.
      Some runners participate in local events or travel to race destinations with their running buddies.

      <h2> Career Benefits </h2>
      While some deals are sealed on the golf course, plenty of important business conversations have also taken place between runners on the road.
      Running with co-workers, clients -- even your boss -- is a great way to network and build your professional relationships in an unassuming way. Meeting new people through running is also a great way to expand your
      professional circles and potentially find a new job or other business opportunities.
      <br>
      <h2> Expand Social Circle</h2>
      Anyone who has run with a group knows that it's a great opportunity to get to know people with similar interests. Many people have met their spouse, significant other,
       or close friends through a running group or club.
      Some runners end up traveling to destination races with friends they've met in running clubs or charity running programs.
